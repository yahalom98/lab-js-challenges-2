   <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  </summary>

 This exercise allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. 

  Upon completion of this exercise, you will be able to:

  - Determine correctly the variable scope and hoisting in JavaScript code,
  - Interpret correctly how hoisting affects the variables and functions in JavaScript code,
  - Determine how variable shadowing affects the variables in JavaScript,

## Introduction

Are you ready to put your coding skills to the test? In this exercise, you will be given a series of short code challenges that simulate the types of questions you may encounter during a Junior Developer job interview. The challenges are designed to help you practice and reflect on the concepts of scope, hoisting, variable shadowing, and passing value versus passing reference. By examining the code and trying to predict the output, you will put your problem-solving skills to the test and gain a better understanding of how these concepts work in JavaScript.

## Instructions

We encourage you to try to solve the challenges without running the code first. Once you have written down your answer for a challenge, run the code and check if your answer was correct. If your answer was incorrect, try to understand why the code behaves the way it does.

<br>

You should record your answers in the `answers.md` file and provide a brief explanation for each answer. For example:

```text
1. Challenge 1:
  - Answer: a
  - Explanation: The output of the code will be "123" because...
```

<br>

### Challenge 1

```javascript
// Challenge 1
let foo = "abc";

function bar() {
  foo = "xyz";
  console.log(foo);
}

bar();


console.log(foo);
```

<br>

Given the code above, answer the following questions:

1. Which of the following will be the output of the above code? Why?
  <br>a) `"abc"` and `"xyz"`
  <br>b) `"xyz"` and `"xyz"`
  <br>c) `undefined` and `"xyz"`
  <br>d) ReferenceError: foo is not defined


<br>

Once you write down your answer, run the code above and check if it is correct.

<br>

<details>
  <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

  <br>

- **Answer**: **`b`** - `"xyz"` and `"xyz"`

- **Explanation**: The function `bar` reassigns the value of the global variable `foo` to `"xyz"`.

</details>

<br>

### Challenge 2

```javascript
// Challenge 2
let a = 1;

function example(a) {
  a = 10;
  console.log(a); // Console log 1
}

example(a);


console.log(a);  // Console log 2
```

<br>

Given the code above, without running the code, answer the following question:

1. Which of the following will be the output of the above code? Why?
  <br>a) `10` and `10`
  <br>b) `1` and `10`
  <br>c) `10` and `1`
  <br>d) ReferenceError: a is not defined


<br>

Once you write down your answer, run the code above and check if it is correct.

<br>

<details>
  <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

  <br>

- **Answer**: **`c`** - `10` and `1`

- **Explanation**: The function `example` has a parameter `a`. In Javascript, the **function parameters are by default created as local variables**. Therefore, the `a` inside the function is a local variable, and the `a` outside the function is a global variable. The function `example` reassigns the value of the local variable `a` to `10`, but the global variable `a` remains unchanged.

<br>

### Challenge 3

```javascript
// Challenge 3

sayHi();

function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hi there!");
}
```

<br>

Given the code above, without running the code, answer the following question:
1. What will be the output of the code above? Why?
  <br>a) `ReferenceError: sayHi is not defined`
  <br>b) `undefined`
  <br>c) `"Hi there!"`
  <br>d) `TypeError: sayHi is not a function`

<br>

Once you write down your answer, run the code above and check if your answer was correct.

<br>

<details>
  <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

  <br>

- **Answer**: **`c`** - `"Hi there!"`

- **Explanation**: The function `sayHi` is hoisted to the top of the file, so it is available to be called before it is declared.

  <br>

</details>

<br>

### Challenge 4

```javascript
const a = { num: 42 };
const b = a; 

b.num = 90;

console.log(a);
```

<br>

Given the code above, without running the code, answer the following question:
1. What will be the output of the code above? Why?
  <br>a) TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
  <br>b) `{ num: 42 }`
  <br>c) `{ num: 90 }`
  <br>d) ReferenceError: a is not defined


<br>

Once you write down your answer, run the code above and check if your answer was correct.

<br>

<details>
  <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

  <br>

- **Answer**: **`b`** - `{ num: 90 }`

- **Explanation**: The variable `a` stores a reference to an object. When we assign the value of `a` to `b`, we are copying the reference to the object. Therefore, `a` and `b` are pointing to the same object. When we change the value of the property `num` of the object, we are changing the value of the property `num` of the object that both `a` and `b` are pointing to.

### Bonus: Challenge 5 | Two Rabbits and a Magic Hat :rabbit: :rabbit2: :tophat:

```javascript
function magicHat(obj) {
  obj.age = 10;
  obj = { name: "Ada", age: 20 };
  return obj;
}
  
const rabbit1 = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };
  
const rabbit2 = magicHat(rabbit1);
  
console.log('rabbit1: ', rabbit1);
console.log('rabbit2: ', rabbit2);
```

<br>

Given the code above, without running the code, answer the following question:
1. What will be the output of the code above? Why?
  <br>a) `{ name: "Bob", age: 30 }` and `{ name: "Ada", age: 20 }`
  <br>b) `{ name: "Bob", age: 30 }` and `{ name: "Bob", age: 10 }`
  <br>c) `{ name: "Bob", age: 10 }` and `{ name: "Ada", age: 20 }`
  <br>d) ReferenceError: obj is not defined

<br>

Once you write down your answer, run the code above and check if your answer was correct.

<br>


<details>
  <summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

  <br>

- **Answer**: **`c`**
  ```javascript
  console.log('rabbit1: ', rabbit1); // -> { name: "Bob", age: 10 }
  console.log('rabbit2: ', rabbit2); // -> { name: "Ada", age: 20 }
  ```
    
  <br>

- **Explanation**: 

  The challenge has a catch that involves two specific concepts in JavaScript:
  
  (1) First, functions in JavaScript create their own internal variables for each parameter/argument passed to them.<br>
  (2) Second, objects (objects, arrays and functions) in JavaScript are copied by reference.

  We first store `rabbit1`'s reference in the functions internal variable `obj` created automatically for the parameter `obj`.

  On line `obj.age = 10`, variable `obj` holds a reference that points to the object passed as an argument, therefore we change the age of `rabbit1`.

  On the next line `obj = { name: "Ada", age: 20 };` , we create a totally new object and assign it to the functions internal variable `obj`. Therefore obj after this line points to the new object in memory `{ name: "Ada", age: 20 }`.

  Finally, the function returns the reference stored in `obj`. That reference is being saved in the variable `rabbit2``, therefore making the `rabbit2` to point to the object `{ name: "Ada", age: 20 }`.
